HomeIO - PHP smart home mobile webpage (2024 holiday vacation project)

Controls Govee and Philips Hue devices (Govee's public API has very restrictive rate limiting. Switching to Hue due to the Hue bridge local API)

Listens to x10 remote input through x10 Commander log (Using CM15a on Windows PC)
